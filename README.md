The LCD system
--------------

A series of modules written in OCaml to do various stuff using Adafruit's
LCD + backpack for the Raspberry Pi:

* show the currently playing song from FIP
* show the currently playing show from France Culture
* show the currently playing stream's name from Pulseaudio
* show notifications received over the network

Once I get the corresponding hardware:

* turn on relays for my drawing room's light and hi-fi system whenever my tablet
  shows up on the wifi network (meaning I'm home)
